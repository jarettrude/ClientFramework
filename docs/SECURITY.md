## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Code Review**: All code changes require at least one review from a team member before merging.
2. **Secrets Management**: Never commit sensitive credentials, API keys, or tokens to the repository.
3. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update and audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
4. **Static Code Analysis**: Use automated tools to identify potential security issues during the development process.

### For Repository Administrators

1. **Access Control**: Implement the principle of least privilege - grant only the permissions necessary for contributors to perform their duties.
2. **Branch Protection**: Enforce branch protection rules to prevent unauthorized changes to important branches.
3. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regularly scan the codebase for vulnerabilities.
4. **Security Logging**: Maintain logs of repository access and modifications.
5. **Documentation**: Keep security documentation up-to-date.

## Dependency Management

1. **Regular Updates**: Dependencies should be updated regularly to incorporate security patches.
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use automated tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
3. **Dependency Pinning**: Pin dependencies to specific versions to prevent unexpected changes.
4. **Dependency Review**: Review the security posture of new dependencies before adding them to the project.

## Data Protection

1. **Sensitive Data**: Do not store sensitive data in the repository.
